						Welcome to Sugar Mutts Rescue and Skymeadow Farm Sanctuary!
						<br /><br />
						Sugar Mutts Rescue, Inc. is an independent, 501(c)(3)/non-profit, foster-based rescue group founded upon the core belief
						that all dogs are created equal. Based in Brooklyn, Sugar Mutts Rescue was created by Amy Marciano, an ardent Pit
						Bull/Staffordshire Terrier supporter and total animal admirer. Our dogs are rescued directly from high-kill shelters, whether
						it be Animal Care & Control here in New York or various shelters down south, where thousands are euthanized every year due to
						lack of resources and lack of space. Although we have a particular soft spot for the dogs that are most discriminated against,
						we rescue all different breeds of all different ages. The majority of them are saved just in the nick of time, so choosing to
						adopt undoubtedly saves lives!
						<br /><br />
						Sugar Mutts advocates against back-yard breeders, puppy mills, and the selling of animals for profit. We support education and
						understanding of all dog breeds and encourage people to try and see beyond the media-sanctioned stereotypes and ignorance that
						exists. Dogs are amazing, intelligent, and affectionate creatures who could teach us humans a great deal.
						<br /><br />
						The key to a successful adoption is simply finding the right canine-human match. We also provide adopters with helpful
						information like food and toy recommendations, vet and trainer referrals, tips on preventative care, and useful reading on dog
						behavior and training.
						<br /><br />
						Our adoption fee for any dog is $300 and all our sugar mutts will be spayed/neutered, vaccinated (Distemper/Parvo, Bordetella,
						Rabies), heartworm tested, and microchipped prior to adoption. If we do not currently have the right match for you, you are
						welcome to e-mail us about what your ideal dog would be like. We will try and find you your canine match and contact you when
						we rescue a potential candidate!

					<h4 class="white lg-margin-bottom">Founder of Sugar Mutts Rescue and Skymeadow Farm Sanctuary</h4>
					<p>
						Having always been completely crazy about animals, I have worked in the animal welfare field in various capacities throughout
						the course of the last decade. I've worked in the private no-kill sector, the public high-kill sector, in veterinary care, dog
						walking, doggie daycare, training, and even as a pet portrait photographer. Amidst all those valuable experiences, my unwavering
						desire to be focusing solely on rescue was always apparent.
						<br /><br />
						Animals have been my passion ever since I was on all fours myself. Dogs in particular have an incredible ability to make us
						inadequate humans feel needed, loved, and so special (a gift we really don't deserve considering the direction we've taken this
						planet and it's non-human creatures). I figure the absolute least we can do in return is treat these wonderful beasts of the
						canine persuasion with kindness and respect. The overpopulation problem is, after all, our fault-- not theirs. We are the reason
						why 8 to 12 million companion animals end up in U.S. shelters every year with 60% of them being euthanized. We domesticated them,
						bred them for our various uses, and didn't bother to spay and neuter as a standard practice. Human greed and our desire for
						instant gratification has led to shelters bursting at the seams with no alternatives. "No kill" organizations simply turn animals
						away, making them someone else's problem, knowing full well that the "someone else" is most likely a kill shelter. So, what's the
						solution? I honestly don't believe there is a truly fair solution where no animals will suffer. I do believe however, with all of
						my heart, that an individual can make a difference and that difference can be measured by a wagging tail. Long or stubby, straight
						or curly, soft or bristly... to them, it makes all the difference in the world.
						<br /><br />
						So, with that belief, Sugar Mutts Rescue was born. With the staggering number of dogs in need and knowing that there is nothing
						else that I'd rather dedicate my life's work to, there was just no reason not to start my own rescue. Sugar Mutts was affectionately
						named after my own much-adored rescue mutt, Gandalf (the handsome little guy to the right). At only two months old, he had ended up
						at the AC&C as a stray. He quickly wiggled his way into my heart and naturally acquired the irresistable nickname "sugar mutt."
